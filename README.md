# testscoring &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mkokotovich/testscoring.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mkokotovich/testscoring)

### Local Development
To bring up the backend: `docker-compose up`. Then run `scripts/first_run.sh` to apply initial migrations and create a test user.

To bring up UI: 

```
cd ui
yarn install
yarn start
```

### Contributing
Fork the repo, make your changes, then submit a pull request. Be sure your pull request includes any migrations that were created.

Please install and use the flake8 pre-commit hook, this will help PRs stay focused on the important things:

```
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

### Adding new assessments
To add new assessments, create an assessment class and add it to the "assessments" list in `backend/apps/testing/v1_views.py`. See another assessment for an example and the comments in `backend/apps/testing/utils.py`

Once the assessment class has been created, a slug and readable name need to be added to the `TEST_TYPE_CHOICES` field in the Test model in `backend/apps/testing/models.py`. Again, just follow the patterns that are there.

Because this changes the database model, a migration needs to be created. Exec into the docker container (`docker-compose exec api sh`) and run `python manage.py makemigrations`. This will find the changes and write them to a file. To test the changes, apply the migrations (run `python manage.py migrate`) and then use the UI to use the new assessment. 

### Tests
There are tests in `backend/tests` that can be used to ensure that the scoring logic for assessments doesn't change. 

First, score a test on the website and verify that it matches the score when scored manually. This ensures that the scoring logic is correct. 

Then download the test items and scoring data for that test by running:  

```
USERNAME=<username> PASSWORD=<password> TESTID=<testid> python scripts/generate_test_data.py
```

The TESTID variable is the id from the URL when viewing the test. Move two files this script creates to `backend/tests/internal/data` and rename appropriately (following the existing patterns).

Then add the new test and scoring data to `backend/tests/internal/apps/testing/test_scoring.py`. Again, follow the existing patterns and it should be pretty straightforward. 

Tests can be ran by exec'ing into the docker container (`docker-compose exec api sh`) and running `cd backend/tests; pytest`
